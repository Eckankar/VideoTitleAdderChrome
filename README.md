Video Title Adder for Chrome
============
> Displays the title of a YouTube video in the link.

One of the things I often find annoying when surfing the web is YouTube™ links with no explaining text.
This Chrome extension seeks to remedy this by displaying the title of the video as a part of every YouTube™ link.

## Installation
Video Title Adder currently can be [installed] via the Chrome Web Store. Simply click install and you should be ready to go!

## Usage
Browse a website with a YouTube™ link on it!  
The link will automatically get converted to the title of the video it links to.
