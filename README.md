# Video Title Adder

[![N|Solid][storeimgsmall]][store]

Video Title Adder is a [Chrome Extension][store] that adds the title and hover preview of any YouTube(tm) video in the referring link.

As you can see above, every YouTube(tm) link is appended with `(YT: Video Title)` while the other links are left alone such as the Streamable link.

### What VTA Can Do
Seems simple enough so you might be asking yourself, **Why do I want this?** Well...:
  - VTA can help determine if a video is viewable in your country/private (Content Cop below is a private video) !["VTA Detecting Private Video"][private]
  - VTA can give you a thumbnail preview and total time of the video when you hover over the link !["Hover Preview"][preview]
  - VTA lets you watch the video without leaving the page by clicking the play button !["Inline Viewer"][inline]

  - But most importantly, _**VTA Prevents Rick Rolls!**_ !["Don't get rickrolled"][rickroll]

If Rick Astley had VTA when he did his AMA, he wouldn't have been _**self-rolled.**_



### Download/Install
Now that you're totally convinced you need VTA, you're probably thinking, **How can I get this?**

It's simple, just download it from the Chrome Extension Store by visiting the link below and clicking *"Add to Chrome"*
