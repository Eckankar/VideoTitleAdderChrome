# VideoTitleAdderChrome

VideoTitleAdderChrome is a chrome extension that allows you to preload any YouTube links you may come across while browsing the web. After preloading the links, it appends the tilte of the video to the link in the referring page. Using VideoTitleAdderChrome eliminates the need to click unclear YouTube links in order to determine the content of them and seeks to remedy this by displaying the title of the video as a part of every YouTube link.

## Download & Installation
